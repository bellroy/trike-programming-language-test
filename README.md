# Trike

## Problem solving

Write a class that applies the following rules (in order of precedence) to any string it is passed:

* If a character has the same character to its left and right, it should be replaced with that other
  character (i.e. AWA becomes AAA) unless the surrounding character is a space
* Any sequence of six characters should be replaced with a single character, i.e. AAAAAA becomes A
* Any instance of the exclamation mark (!) character causes the string to be reversed, and the
  exclamation mark character removed

Commit each step of your development process. When you're done, try running it on the following
string and see what result you get (hint: you'll know when you've done it right):

## Expanding your programming comprehension

We love programming at Trike. We love to explore what benefits and tradeoffs that other languages
have to offer in solving our day to day problems.

Although we primarily do a lot of [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) programming, we also like
looking at other languages that help us reason about our code on a daily basis.

Here is the challenge. Either:

1. Take a list of `integer`s on standard input, one per line, and return them in reverse order on
   standard output, or;
2. Take a `string` on standard input and return the string reversed on standard output.

Conditions:

1. You must do this in a language that you have not programmed in before.
2. You must not use a library that provides a `reverse` method or function.

That's it!

Here are some of the languages (in no particular order) that we use at Trike on the side to help us
solve problems.
[Rust](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), [Swift](https://swift.org), [Haskell](haskell.org),
[C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)), [Elm](http://elm-lang.org),
[Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org)

Feel free to use one of these languages, or choose your own, there are
[a lot of programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages) to
choose from :)
