# Trike - Programming Language Test

**A simple exercise to expand your programming comprehension**

We love programming at Trike. We love to explore what benefits and tradeoffs that other languages have to offer in solving our day to day problems.

Although we primarily do a lot of [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) programming, we also like looking at other languages that help us reason about our code on a daily basis.

Here is the challenge. Either:

1. Take a list of `integer`s on standard input one per line and return them in reverse order on standard output, or;
2. Take a `string` on standard input and and return the string reversed on standard output.

Conditions:

1. You must do this in a language that you have not programmed in before.
2. You must not use a library that provides a `reverse` method or function.

That's it!

Here are some of the languages (in no particular order) that we use at Trike on the side to help us solve problems.
[Rust](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), [Swift](https://swift.org), [Haskell](haskell.org), [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language))

Feel free to use one of these languages, or choose your own, there are [a lot of programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages) to choose from :)
